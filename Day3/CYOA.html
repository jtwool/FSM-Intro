	<h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
	<p id="story">
	
You've lived all your life in a sleepy fishing village. Your father was a fisherman, his father was a fisherman and, because you have no brothers or sisters, you followed in their footsteps: you are a fisherman. Recently, however, a dragon has been terrorizing the village! It flies high above your village, circling and breathing fire, until the people have been worked into a frenzy. Then, the dragon lands and demands tribute in the form of food, gold and jewels. Your village has had enough. The townsfolk took a vote and have selected you to be the champion.
