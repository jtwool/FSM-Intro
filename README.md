### Description
Programming is an interdisciplinary skill that requires a little of each of language, math, logic, critical thinking and problem solving. This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of programming in six sessions over two weeks. Each day, students will learn new concepts during a brief lecture, practice new skills during pair-programming time, play a brief creativity game, and work-together to build the day's capstone project.

### Objectives
1. Excite students about programming
2. Encourage students to see programming a career path
3. Teach students basics of programming (logical structure and data types)
4. Expose students to a wide array of programming tasks

### Lesson Plan
###### Day 1: Guess the Number
In day one, students are introduced to the basics of JavaScript programming language. The idea of programming is explained. Students are taught simple syntax, numbers and math.
###### Day 2: Pig Latin and Secret Codes
Day two, students explore string handling and basic logic, building a pig-latin translator and a Ceaser's code translator.
###### Day 3: Choose Your Fate
 Students expand upon their knowledge of logical programming building a rudimentary choose your own adventure game.
###### Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors  
Day three, students build a rock-paper-scissors game, using loops, if-else logic, comparisons and more.
###### Day 5: Hangman
Students return to string handling by building a hangman / Wheel of Fortune game. Continued emphasis on programming logic, problem solving, and procedural thinking.
###### Day 6: Websites
Students are introduced to the power of JavaScript for manipulating websites, including DOM manipulation with JQuery.

### Grading
This course is ungraded. Students who complete at least three problems in each of the six pairs-programming problem sets will be awarded a certificate of completion.
